# Purpose
  * Just a few notes on my thoughts after completing this project

# Getting Started
  1. I did use yarn for all of my commands through the terminal for this, I tested what I could on my machine to make sure that it will run across machines, fingers crossed.
  2. After doing a `yarn` in the folder to install the modules, `yarn watch` will run the dev environment
  3. If you have issues with this, multiple terminals can be used running `yarn start:server` then `yarn start:client`

# Thoughts
  * I had a lot of features that I wanted to continue to expand on, namely I wanted to implement Postgres on the back end for some server persistance, as well as some fashion of testing being the most important two.
  
  * I also wanted to have this deployed, but that fell on the back burner to the core features requested

  * I put together the entirety of this code base from the webpack to the css, I dabbled with using things like create-react-app and other boiler plates but I felt that they would do too much for me and I wanted to really show what I am capable of.
  
  * I made sure I did things in multiple different ways across the project to show the different approaches I am aware of and comfortable with.
